# Samano Brand Insurance Checker 🕌

In this mini project, a brand name for **Samano** (a traditional Nowruz food) is given as input.  
According to the rule, the Samano is considered **"Abolfazl-Insured"** if the brand name **does not contain the letter `m`**.  
If the letter `m` exists anywhere in the string, the product is not insured.


## 🧠 Project Logic
- Input: a lowercase English string up to 20 characters
- Condition:  
  - If the string contains `m` → print `No`  
  - Otherwise → print `Yes`

## ▶️ Sample Input & Output

| Input      | Output |
|------------|--------|
| `bitpin`   | Yes    |
| `samanoo`  | No     |


## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
