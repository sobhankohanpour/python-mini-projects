    "## Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Two countries, **Shekarestan** and **Namakestan**, which have roughly equal populations, have used different medications to treat their COVID-19 patients. Both countries have reported the number of confirmed cases and deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to determine which country’s treatment was more effective. The country with a higher number of recovered patients is considered to have used a more effective treatment. The number of recovered patients in a country is calculated as the difference between the total number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths.\n"
